# Complex Variables by Levinson and Redheffer: A Classic Textbook on Functions of Complex Variables
 
Complex variables are an important topic in mathematics, especially in analysis, differential equations, and physics. They deal with functions that have complex numbers as inputs and outputs, and explore their properties, such as continuity, differentiability, integration, and series expansion.
 
One of the most popular and influential textbooks on complex variables is *Complex Variables* by Norman Levinson and Raymond Redheffer, first published in 1970[^1^]. This book covers the basic theory of complex variables, as well as applications to harmonic functions, conformal mapping, potential theory, and boundary value problems. It also includes topics such as the Riemann zeta function, the prime number theorem, and the Riemann mapping theorem.

Complex variables have many applications in various fields of science and engineering. For example, complex analysis can be used to solve ordinary differential equations that arise in modeling physical phenomena, such as heat conduction, fluid flow, and electric circuits. Complex analysis can also be used to perform Fourier and Laplace transforms, which are powerful tools for analyzing signals and systems in frequency domain.
 
One of the main advantages of complex analysis is that it simplifies many calculations and proofs by using the properties of complex functions. For instance, complex functions that are analytic (have a complex derivative) satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which imply that they are infinitely differentiable and have convergent Taylor series. Moreover, analytic functions satisfy the Cauchy integral formula, which relates their values inside a domain to their values on the boundary. This formula leads to many important results, such as the residue theorem, the maximum modulus principle, and Liouville's theorem.
 
Another benefit of complex analysis is that it provides a natural way to visualize and understand geometric transformations of the plane. For example, complex functions can be used to map regions of the complex plane to other regions, such as circles, ellipses, or polygons. These mappings are called conformal mappings, because they preserve angles between curves. Conformal mappings have applications in fluid mechanics, electrostatics, and aerodynamics.
