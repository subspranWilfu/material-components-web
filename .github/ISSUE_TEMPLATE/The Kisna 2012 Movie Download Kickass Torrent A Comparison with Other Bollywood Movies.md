Kisna: The Warrior Poet is a 2005 Indian Hindi-language period romance film written, edited, produced and directed by Subhash Ghai and starring Vivek Oberoi, Antonia Bernath, and Isha Sharvani[^3^]. The film is set in the British India of the tumultuous 1940s when Indian nationalists fighting for the country's independence rose up as one, urging the British Raj to leave. It is a love story about two people who are torn between Karma (the noble deed) and Dharma (the duty). The film has two veteran composers, A. R. Rahman and Ismail Darbar; the lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar[^3^].
 
The film was premiered in the MarchÃ© du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival[^3^] [^4^] but did not perform well at the box office. The film marked Amrish Puri's last appearance as he had not signed or acted in any film after it before passing away on 12 January 2005[^3^].

The film follows the journey of Kisna and Catherine as they try to reach Delhi safely, while facing various obstacles and enemies along the way. Kisna's fiancÃ©e Lakshmi is heartbroken and angry at his betrayal, and joins forces with Prince Raghuraj, a ruthless British loyalist who wants to capture and kill Catherine. Kisna's friend Nandu also betrays him and informs Raghuraj of their whereabouts. Kisna's elder brother Shankar Singh, a freedom fighter, tries to convince him to join the cause and leave Catherine behind. Kisna's mentor Bhairon Singh, a wise and noble man, supports his decision and guides him through his dilemma. Kisna's childhood friend Jumman Miya, a Muslim poet and musician, also accompanies them and provides comic relief.
 
The film has several songs and dances that showcase the culture and diversity of India. The film also depicts the historical events and figures of the Indian independence movement, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, etc. The film ends with a climactic confrontation between Kisna and Raghuraj at the Red Fort, where Kisna sacrifices his life to save Catherine. Catherine returns to England with a heavy heart, but cherishes the memories of her true love. She also becomes a supporter of India's freedom and donates her wealth to the cause.
 
The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the performances, music, cinematography, and costumes of the film, while others criticized the screenplay, direction, editing, and historical accuracy of the film. The film was also compared unfavorably to other period films such as Lagaan (2001) and The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002). The film was a commercial failure at the box office, recovering only a fraction of its budget.
