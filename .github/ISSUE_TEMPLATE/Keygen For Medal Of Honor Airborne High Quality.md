In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the features and aspects of Medal of Honor: Airborne that make it a revolutionary WWII shooter.
 
## Airborne Gameplay
 
One of the most distinctive features of Medal of Honor: Airborne is the airborne gameplay. Unlike most shooter games where you start each mission on the ground, in this game you start each mission in the air, jumping from a plane and parachuting into the battlefield. This gives you the opportunity to choose your own landing spot and approach to each objective. You can land anywhere you want, as long as it is within the boundaries of the map. You can also steer your parachute and control your descent speed to avoid enemy fire and obstacles.
 
Choosing your landing spot is not only a matter of preference, but also a matter of strategy. Depending on where you land, you will have different advantages and disadvantages. For example, landing on a rooftop will give you a good vantage point and cover, but also make you more visible and vulnerable to snipers. Landing on the street will give you more mobility and access to vehicles, but also expose you to more enemies and crossfire. Landing near an objective will allow you to complete it faster, but also put you in more danger. Landing far from an objective will give you more time to plan and prepare, but also make you lose precious time and resources.
 
Choosing your landing spot also affects the way the game unfolds. The game uses a dynamic AI system that adapts to your actions and choices. The enemies will react differently depending on where you land and what you do. They will try to flank you, ambush you, call for reinforcements, retreat, or surrender depending on the situation. The game also features a non-linear mission structure that allows you to complete the objectives in any order you want. You can follow the main path or explore the side areas for more challenges and rewards. You can also replay each mission with different landing spots and strategies to experience different outcomes and scenarios.
 
## Weapon Customization
 
Another feature that sets Medal of Honor: Airborne apart from other WWII shooters is the weapon customization system. In this game, you can modify and upgrade your weapons as you progress through the game. You can attach different scopes, sights, barrels, stocks, grips, magazines, bayonets, silencers, and other accessories to your weapons to improve their performance and appearance. You can also switch between different types of ammunition such as armor-piercing, incendiary, explosive, or tracer rounds to suit different situations and enemies.

You can upgrade your weapons by using them in combat and earning experience points for each kill or action. As you level up your weapons, you will unlock new attachments and options for them. You can also find hidden weapon parts scattered throughout the maps that can be used to further enhance your weapons. You can customize your weapons at any time during the game by accessing the weapon selection menu.
 
Customizing your weapons is not only fun and satisfying, but also essential for surviving the game. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses that affect their performance in different situations and environments. For example, a sniper rifle will be more effective in long-range engagements than a shotgun, but less effective in close-quarters combat. A submachine gun will be more effective in urban areas than a rifle, but less effective in open fields. A silenced pistol will be more effective in stealth missions than a machine gun, but less effective in firefights. Therefore, choosing the right weapon for each mission and modifying it accordingly is crucial for achieving success.
